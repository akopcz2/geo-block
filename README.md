##### Built with Creact React App

#### POC for geoblocking react components based on IP or Country

Restrict Component is making a get request to https://ipapi.co/json/
<br>
Based on the response and a comparison to the blocklist, the component is/isn't rendered


Add/remove the country and your ip from the blocklist to Show/Hide components based on IP.

### To-do
Instead of having this as an entire Component, we can break out this functionality into props ie {isBlocked}
Server-Side implementation
